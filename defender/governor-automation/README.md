# Governor Automation

This Autotask will check for proposal events that have been emitted by an [OpenZepplin Governor](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/governance) or [OpenZepplin GovernorCompatibilityBravo](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/governance#GovernorCompatibilityBravo) contract.

If a proposal has been passed (has a state of Succeeded), then the Autotask will queue it in a Timelock (if a Timelock exists) or execute it directly (if no Timelock exists). If the proposal is already queued in a Timelock, the Autotask will check when the proposal can be executed (by checking the ETA value) and execute it if possible.

## Optimizations

During the first run of the Autotask, it will scan from block zero to the latest block. It will then track the earliest block that still has an Active, Pending, Queued proposal. This block number will be stored in the `startingBlock` variable using the Defender KVStore. Future scans will from `startingBlock` to `latest` to reduce the number of blockchain calls.

## Defender Account Setup

- In your [Defender account](https://defender.openzeppelin.com/), select the Hamburger icon in the upper right corner and click on **Team API Keys**
- In the Team API Keys screen, click **Create API Key**
- Make sure that the options for **Manage Relayers**, **Manage Autotasks**, and **Manage Sentinels** are selected (we do not make use of the **Create Admin proposals and contracts** option)
- Click **Save**
- Copy your API key and Secret key to a local file (you will **NOT** be able to view your API secret again after this message box goes away)
- Make sure that you really did copy your API key and Secret key to a local file
- Check the box for **Iâ€™ve written down the secret key** and select **Close**

## Local Code Setup

In the `defender` directory, perform the following steps:

- Run `npm i` to install the necessary Node packages
- A secrets file can be created for each stage of production. We will create one for development
  - Copy and rename the `sample.secrets.yml` to `.secrets/dev.yml`
  - Modify the two lines in the `.secrets/dev.yml` file, replacing the portion in the angle brackets `<>` with your Defender API key and secret key, as indicated:
  - `defender-api-key: <API Key goes here>`
  - `defender-api-secret: <API Secret goes here>`
- Change directories to the stack that will be deployed
  - `cd governance-automation`
- Modify the `governor-contract-address` value in the `config.yml` file
- Modify the `autotask-frequency` value in the `config.yml` file
- Run `serverless deploy` to deploy the stack to Defender
