# Wallet Migrator

This Defender Autotask will automatically transfer all ERC20 and ERC721 tokens from a user's wallet address to another specified wallet address.

## Defender Account Setup

- In your [Defender account](https://defender.openzeppelin.com/), select the Hamburger icon in the upper right corner and click on **Team API Keys**
- In the Team API Keys screen, click **Create API Key**
- Make sure that the options for **Manage Relayers**, **Manage Autotasks**, and **Manage Sentinels** are selected (we do not make use of the **Manage Proposals and Contracts** option)
- Click **Save**
- Copy your API key and Secret key to a local file (you will **NOT** be able to view your API secret again after this message box goes away)
- Make sure that you really did copy your API key and Secret key to a local file
- Check the box for **Iâ€™ve written down the secret key** and select **Close**

### Covalent API Key Setup

This template will make use of [Covalent's API](https://www.covalenthq.com/docs/api/balances/get-token-balances-for-address/) to query for all 
all balances of ERC20 and ERC721 tokens of the sender's specified wallet address. To get an API key, navigate to [Covalent's website](https://www.covalenthq.com/)
and select **Get an API key**. Follow the instructions to sign up for an account, or login to your existing account if you already have one.
Once you are logged in and have created an API Key, you can navigate to your home platform [page](https://www.covalenthq.com/platform/#/) where the API key is shown. 
Write down your API Key is a safe place, as you will need it for later steps.

## Local Code Setup

In the `defender` directory, perform the following steps:

- Run `yarn install` to install the necessary Node packages
- A secrets file can be created for each stage of production. We will create one for development
  - Copy and rename `sample.secrets.yml` to `.secrets/dev.yml`
  - Modify the following lines in the `.secrets/dev.yml` file, replacing the portion in the angle brackets `<>` with your Defender API key, Secret key, as indicated:
    - `defender-api-key: <API Key goes here>`
    - `defender-api-secret: <API Secret goes here>`
    - `covalent-api-key: <Covalent API Key goes here>`
- Change directories to the stack that will be deployed
  - `cd wallet-migrator`
- A config file can be created for each stage of production. We will create one for development
  - Copy and rename `sample.config.yml` to `config.dev.yml`
  - Open the file and modify the following values:
    - `sender-wallet-address` 
    - `receiver-wallet-address`
    - `network`
- Run `serverless deploy --stage dev` to deploy the stack to Defender

## Token Approval Script Setup

In order to have all ERC20 and ERC721 tokens automatically transfered, you must first approve an allowance to the Relayer that is played with your Defender Stack.

From the root of this repo, follow these steps to run the approval script:

- Create/modify the `.env` file
- Add your RPC URL to perform on-chain transactions
  - `GOERLI_RPC_URL: <Your Goerli RPC URL here>` add this field if you are using the Goerli Testnet, otherwise leave empty.
  - `MAINNET_RPC_URL: <Your Goerli RPC URL here>` add this field if you are using Mainnet, otherwise leave empty.
  - `COVALENT_API_KEY: <Your Covalent API Key goes here>`

Make sure that your Defender Serverless stack is deployed BEFORE you run the following script. The following script will approve all ERC20 and ERC721 tokens 
from your wallet address to the deployed relayer's address. From the root of this repo, run 
`yarn node defender/wallet-migrator/approveTokens.js`
