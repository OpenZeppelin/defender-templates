# Bridge Automation

This Defender Autotask will periodically check for the balance of a specific address to monitor on Arbitrum.

If the balance of the address falls below a specified threshold, then the Autotask will automatically bridge
from the L1 side to the L2 side.

There is a Defender Relayer setup on the L1 side (Ethereum) and another Defender Relayer that is setup on
the L2 side (Arbitrum), both with the same address. Because of [address aliasing](https://developer.arbitrum.io/arbos/l1-to-l2-messaging#eth-deposits), 
the two Defender Relayers are needed to bridge from EOA to EOA.

## Defender Account Setup

- In your [Defender account](https://defender.openzeppelin.com/), select the Hamburger icon in the upper right corner and click on **Team API Keys**
