# How often should the Autotask run? (in minutes)
# It can take about 10 minutes for the bridge transaction from L1 Relay -> L2 Relay to confirm
# Setting the frequency lower may mean running the Autotask when the bridge transaction has not settled
# Setting the frequency too high may mean that the full transfer from L2 Relay -> L2 monitored address is not punctual
# Defaults to 15 mintues to allow for first Autotask run to bridge funds, and second Autotask run to transfer to monitored address
autotask-frequency: 15
