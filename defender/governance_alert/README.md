    - `defender-api-secret: <Secret Key goes here>`
- Change directories to the stack that will be deployed
  - `cd governance_alert`
- A config file can be created for each stage of production. We will create one for development
  - Copy and rename `sample.config.yml` to `config.dev.yml`
  - Open the file and modify the following values:
    - `block_explorer_base_url`
    - `monitored-addresses`
